# 🖼️ AI Image Caption Generator  
Create expressive, human-like captions for any image using BLIP + T5 💡  

This project is an AI-powered application that generates both **standard captions** and **creatively rewritten captions** for images.  
Built with **Python, Transformers, and Gradio**, it delivers captions that feel more descriptive, poetic, and human.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 **1. Automatic Image Captioning**
Uses **BLIP (Salesforce)** to generate a base caption from any uploaded image.

### ✍️ **2. Creative Caption Rewriting**
A second model (**T5-small**) rewrites the caption to make it:
- More expressive  
- More descriptive  
- More human  
- More visually rich  

### 🎛️ **3. Clean, Minimal Web Interface (Gradio)**
Upload → Generate → Copy Caption  
Smooth workflow and fast results.

### 🧩 **4. Local-Model Execution**
Runs 100% locally (CPU support) without needing an API key.

### 📦 **5. Lightweight & Easy to Run**
Just install dependencies and launch the app with a single command.
